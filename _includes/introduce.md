## Who are we ?
Youtube Channel Link : [Professional Spectator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqI5lyTpC79pOy2D-VXAMdA?view_as=subscriber)

We are managing a Youtube channel called “Professional Spectator”, which shows the latest meta and play tips for Korean users by analyzing professional players’ plays and available statistical data.


## What do we do ? 
We are uploading contents such as 

1. Patch notes.
2. OP Champions from statistics.
3. Introduction to New Meta.
4. Strategies for each champion to learn through professional play. 
5. Major news in a patch cycle that runs every two weeks. 

 We are trying to keep track of useful and accurate tips based on statistics as much as possible, so the number of subscribers is rapidly increasing recent few months. So far, basic statistical data such as players’ match logs, win, pick and ban rates of each champion, tournament information and patch history have been gathered by referring to lolalytics, probuilds, op.gg (http://op.gg/), fow, champion.gg (http://champion.gg/) and qwer.gg (http://qwer.gg/). However, while running the youtube channel, we could know that there is a lot of information which cannot be obtained from above sites but many of the users wonder. So we started to consider accumulating data through Riot Development APIs and obtaining the statistical values directly needed for the contents.


## Examples of our contents

We are trying to provide our subscribers with useful and interesting information. The following are contents that we will upload.

1. Explaining latest patch note.

    After patch note has been released, we analyze and explain to users in many different angles why Riot had that patch.
1. Best mid-jungle synergy.

    alt="bottom_duo" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

    By using Riot development api, we accumulate data and consistently provide information of ‘synergy’. In league of legends duo makes huge synergy, such as bottom duo, mid-jungle duo, and top-jungle duo. However we can easily find winning rate of solo play, but in case of synergy there are some obstacles. Moreover there are not many information or tips how players can use champions as duo effectively. So we focus on this information and periodically provide users with this information.
1. Blue team vs Purple team
    
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=7ei1fw6pp2U

    alt="blue_vs_purple" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

    After accumulating data, our second content was something that can be useful and interesting to players. It’s comparing winning rate of Blue side and Purple side. Winning rate of Blue side and Purple side is 52:48 led by Blue side. This gap gets bigger when it comes to higher rank games. We explained this by conditional probability of Blue side’s advantage of objects and many players agreed with it. By reading comments we could also find out that bottom lane of Blue side is suffering from the interface covering part of the screen. 

## To-do List

There are a lot more contents that we are preparing right now. I believe if we could get a production key, we could provide more useful and more interesting information faster to users. Following contents are some contents that users are curious about, or could be useful to users. We are planning to accumulate data ourselves and by using that data we will analyze and share the result with users.

1.  By champions, where is there dead zone?
2.	How does First Blood affect the winning rate?
3.	Where is the best spot for each position to ward?
4.	How does AFK in first one minute affect the winning rate?
5.	Comparing most popular bottom duo’s winning rate (champions not professional players)
6.	Which position affect the most to winning rate?


## Vision of our team

Our team’s vision (goal) is to help all league of legends players to keep track of meta, provide contents that players find it interesting and help new players to be attracted to league of legends. On the basis of this vision we will try our best to help players enjoy league of legends. By getting a production key will make this happen faster.
