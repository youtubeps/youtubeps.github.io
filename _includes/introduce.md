## Who are we ?
We are part of PS Analytics Inc, a startup that analyzes game statistics and provides useful features to enhance the gaming experience for players. One of our projects is managing a YouTube channel called "Professional Spectator," which offers Korean users the latest meta and gameplay tips by analyzing professional players' matches and statistical data.

In addition, we operate a website called lol.ps that showcases the latest tierlist of champions and statistics for items, skills, spells, and more. These features help players select champion builds that perform well in the game.
Additionally, we have also developed and operate a website called tftps.gg which provides useful deck statistics and tier lists for the Teamfight Tactics. This website helps users to optimize their gameplay by selecting the most effective strategies and builds.

# VALPS.GG
VALPS.GG is a comprehensive tool for players to search for their match history, analyze their play-style, and receive personalized agent recommendations based on their performance.

One of the main features of VALPS.GG is its ability to provide useful statistics to users. Users can view the recent win rates of agents and weapons on specific maps and regions. Our product aims to help users make more informed decisions by providing them with valuable insights into their performance.

For example, our product is similar to "LOL.PS" for League of Legends, which is a statistical analysis tool designed for beginning players. Our product aims to help players of all levels improve their gameplay by providing detailed statistics and personalized recommendations based on their performance. We plan to use the val-match-v1 API to provide users with the necessary data to make informed decisions.

We are excited to provide our users with the best possible experience and help them improve their gameplay.

Unfortunately, we were unable to create a demo page on the valps.gg domain as we have not yet received approval for the val-match-v1 API. As a result, we are providing the introductory page of our site.
