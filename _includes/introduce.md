## Who are we ? 
We are managing a Youtube channel called "Professional Spectator", which
shows the latest meta and play tips for Korean users through analysis of
progamers' play and available statistical data.

We are uploading contents such as 1) Patch notes, 2) Honey Champions from
statistics, 3) Introduction to New Meta, 4) strategies for each champion to learn
through professional play, and 5) major news and answering curious things
in a patch cycle that runs every two weeks. We are trying to keep track of
useful and accurate tips based on statistics as much as possible, so the
number of subscribers is rapidly increasing recent few month.

So far, basic statistical data such as players' match logs, win, pick and
ban rates of each champion, tournament information and patch history have
been gathered by referring to lolalytics, probuilds, op.gg (http://op.gg/) , fow, champion.gg (http://champion.gg/)
and qwer.gg (http://qwer.gg/) , However, while running the youtube channel, we could know that
there are a lot of information which couldn't obtain from above sites but
many of the users wonder. So we started to consider accumulating data
through the Riot Development API and obtaining the statistical values
directly needed for the contents.

Before we ask for a Production key, we first proved that we could
accumulate data with the Development Key and extract useful tips to help
users play better. We refreshed the development key every day and
accumulated about 150,000 match data of Grandmasters, Masters and
Challengers in KR regions for 14 days. And to find the best bottom duo
combination, we calculated the synergy score for each duo through our own
formula. The results were uploaded to our youtube channel and recorded high
views, and users responded that they were really useful information that
could not be seen anywhere. However, it was also regrettable because we
couldn't make a confident statistic for bottom duo combinations with few
samples.

If we obtain production key, then we can provide more useful and enjoyable
information like above to the users as fast as possible with large data. In
addition, we will be able to provide adaptive information to another
regions as well as South Korea.
Although we do not have a web page or an application, we think our Youtube
channel already has a great community feature. Please consider issuing the
production key and ask us for anything you need for it.
