# tft-ps
- We develop a website named tft-ps which provides useful statistics for tft players when they are playing a game. 
- Tft-ps tries to discover major compositions of champions and gives their pick-rates, win-rates, and deck-powers to the website users.
- The users can decide which deck they are supposed to go on, based on the fluent statistics and information from our product. 
- Also, the users can search the match history of a specific user and follow their decisions about a composition, items, or a build-up methods.  
- We use the APIs for TFT including tft-league, tft-match, and tft-summoner. 
- We hope that the tft-ps becomes a great reference-site for all of the tft users.  
- A demo site will be uploaded here if we collect data continuously using a riot-api key for the personal purpose.

## Service Objectives
- Building healthy e-sports culture and healthy amateur ecosystem

## Service Overview
- A formal online space where amateur teams can conveniently enjoy competing.
- Provide teams with management system/tool to help teams stay active
- Creating an amateur e-sports ecosystem in Korea by holding amateur tournaments and promoting local amateur tournaments.

## Key Functions of The Service
- Member registration with authenticating Member’s Riot account.
- UI that can easily create, join and promote amateur teams and manage team members.
- UI that allows easy registration and application of matches between teams.
- A system that automatically saves the match results after the match and accumulates them to show the team performance.
- A system that creates and displays team rankings based on team performance or activity score every quarter.
- Provide team community pages and calendar UI for scheduling management to all teams.

## APIs used and the target value gained from them
1. API related to riot account authentication when signing up for service
- /lol/summoner/v4/summoners/
- /lol/third-party-code/
- /lol/account/
- When you sign up for the service, by verifying the rank tier of the user and allowing other users to view it, thereby preventing the camouflage tier user from adversely affecting the team game ecosystem.
- To prevent smurf users (users who pretends to be in lower ranks) that adversely affect the team game ecosystem every user’s riot account will be verified and open to public for other users to easily view.

2. API related to match(scrim) application and registration
- /lol/tournament/
- /lol/tournament-stub/
- Team members and viewers of two teams’ scheduled match of quarterly team league and practice games can easily enter the game lobby using tournament code. Also, it allows automatic compiling of the match results in conjunction with match-v4 API.

3. API for organizing Match(scrim) results and managing team performance
- /lol/match/
- After every match, collect information such as winning or losing, collecting objects, tower demolition, global golds, and the type of champion of each team member, KDA, amount of damage and healing, damage received, and kill contribution. This allows teams to know the cumulative wins and losses of each team and manage team rankings on a quarterly basis. Other teams can indirectly identify the champions they use, the individual capabilities of the team members, and prepare ban-pick strategies. Also, based on the results of the team's competition, we can develop training methods to improve team performance by conducting feedback within the teams.

## The Necessity of the Service and Our Vision
-	As the League of Legends e-sports (tournaments) develop and users get tired of problems (i.e., trolls) they face in the solo rank, their craving for team gaming experience that cannot be satisfied in the solo rank have increased. As a result, amateur teams of well-mannered team members are being created, and there are more and more League of Legends amateur competitions in which they can play.
-	Many amateur teams are running their games inefficiently through discord servers, online communities, i.e., Coordinating their match appointments(scrim) without a systematic matching system and managing game results through handwriting. This limits the activities of amateur teams with problems such as no-show, smurf user issues (users who pretends to be in lower ranks), non-transparent team’s record or team’s performances, and inability to analyze detailed game content.
-	This service helps users who want to enjoy the team game elements of League of Legends to easily team up with people who have similar skills and good manners. And it provides an online space where they can conveniently make match appointments(scrim) and devise strategies to improve team performance. With this service, we have a vision to encourage the activities of many amateur teams to create an online amateur ecosystem in which a second Faker like star player can be born. -->
